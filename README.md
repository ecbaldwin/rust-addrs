# Overview

`addrs` provides IP address related types and data structures for the Rust
programming language with a clean and complete API and many nice features. The
basic types are opaque, immutable, comparable, space efficient, and defined as
simple structs that don't require extra memory allocation.

# History

I wrote a [similar package for Go][goaddrs] because I work with addresses and
packets a lot. This one is based it and, in my opinion, much improved. My
motivation for writing this package was to have a good solid learning experience
with Rust and to add to the Rust ecosystem.
